NOTE: Since this repo directly relates to my culture and shit, offensive language is inevitable. Most of the slurs here don't carry the same meaning as in popular culture, and therefore not aiming to offense anyone. Please ignore them if you can, or if you are unable to cope with them, please ignore this shitty repo and have a good day.

(pls don't cancel me because of the autism shit that I put here)
