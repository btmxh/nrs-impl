        <!-- there are several analogies for this -->
        <!-- first, the MC of the story can be thought of a representation of the gigachad mapper, -->
        <!-- who isn't that active with rst anymore. The "Mi" analogy states that deep down -->
        <!-- in their heart, the gigachad mapper still loves rst like in "the glory days". -->

        <!-- second, some 4chan mfs said that Akari Kito ditched rst. -->
        <!-- The analogy states that this situation is because of her -->
        <!-- being forced to do that. -->
