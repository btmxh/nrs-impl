        <!-- -->
        <!-- This piece of rst lore spreaded like wildfire and as a result, it became one of the
        best memes of rst, with rst copyright-claiming both of the words "accident" and "incident".
        As a result, whenever something bad happen, it's an rst reference, like the airship incident
        in [Atelier Escha & Logy: Alchemists of the Dusk
        Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelier_Escha_%26_Logy:_Alchemists_of_the_Dusk_Sky), or
        that time [Akari Kitō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akari_Kit%C5%8D) was unable to show up
        at the Love Live Niji's 5th live. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- ## Background -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- In Summer 2019, [Re:Stage! Dream Days♪](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re:Stage!#Anime),
        one of the anime of all time, was aired. It was pretty underrated, since people are llfags
        who are unable to comprehend the superiority of the glorious franchise. After the end of the
        anime, several albums were released in October and November (after the incident), before the
        franchise goes on hiatus for a year. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- Yumiri Hanamori is one of the eighteen main voice actresses for rst. She has a pretty
        major role in the anime, and was paired with [Ari
        Ozawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Ozawa) in the unit
        [ortensia](https://projectrst.fandom.com/wiki/Ortensia). The unit name is where the incident
        gets its name from. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- ## The incident -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- On November 1, 2019, a notice regarding the *graduation* of Yumiri Hanamori in rst's
        homepage. It referenced a more detailed notice from her affiliation, which also contains her
        feelings with the incident. Although Yumiri Hanamori would still take part in rst 3rd live
        on November 17th, it would be her last time standing on the stage with the role of Haruka
        Itsumura's voice actress. It was also briefly mentioned that the cast of Haruka Itsumura
        would be announced later. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- The reason for Hanamori's graduation was announced to be due to a knee injury, or to be
        exact, *patellar subluxation and meniscal tear*. She was advised not to take part in any
        performances that could put strain on her knees. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- On December 10, 2019, the replacement for Hanamori's role was announced. Tomomi
        Mineuchi, who is known for her voice in [Slow
        Start](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35540/Slow_Start), and [Summer
        Pockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Pockets), would be the cast for Haruka
        Itsumura. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- ## Conspiracy theories -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- Although Hanamori's thoughts were included in the m&i's graduation notice, people were
        still skeptical. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- ### Potentially true reason #1: The anime flopped -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- rst was Pony Canyon's first step into the anime idol industry. They did gave rst a lot
        of help, including anime BGM from [Shingeki no
        Kyojin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan)'s composer, Kohta Yamamoto, as well
        as a wide range of famous VOCALOID producers, like
        [keeno](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/keeno), DECO*27, yuyoyuppe, etc. This clearly had
        shown the vision that Pony Canyon once had with the franchise. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- But after the anime finished airing, rst enjoyers had to wait more than one year to get
        their new album, which was now in a brand new form: *Concept Album*. The next year, they got
        a compilation album, which only included a new song titled *Watashitachi, Shiki o Asobun
        Desu!!*, and some new versions of ortensia songs (because the cast has changed). This made
        people skeptical of the fact that Pony Canyon had dropped their plans with rst, and realized
        that the anime had flopped. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- Knowing about Pony Canyon's vision, Yumiri Hanamori might sensed that rst was not going
        to make it, and decided to leave, since she couldn't change anything if this happen. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- ### Potential true reason #2: ChuChu analogy -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- The ChuChu analogy is an explanation for several voice actresses actions and their
        motives under the hood. It was based on the character ChuChu from the anime [Show by
        Rock!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_by_Rock!!), a girl with great ambition, who would
        consider her current band merely a stepping stone to reach her dreams. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- The analogy stated that in rst, there are several voice actresses with a similar
        mindset. They don't care about the franchise, and just wanted to fill a slot in their
        portfolios. If this was the case for Tomomi Mineuchi, after realizing that the anime was
        going to be unpopular till the end of time, quiting and spending her time for better roles
        should clearly be the superior choice. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- ### Potential true reason #3: Displeasure -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- An anon from 4chan has stated that Hanamori leaving rst was partly due to her
        disinterest with the job in this franchise. This is somewhat widespread, but it doesn't have
        a good backing evidence. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- ### Potential true reason #4: Bullying -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- Prior to the airing of rst anime, Yumiri had a major role in kaguyashit anime, which is
        Hayasaka Ai's voice actress. This may be the reason why she got bullied by her companions,
        which are loyal to the franchise and would never sell their souls to shit franchises. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- (This was just anti-kaguyashit propaganda.) -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- ## Consequences -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- Every major incident after rst were the consequences of the ortensia incident. Many
        people believed that this event has triggered some sort of universal shifts that had forever
        changed the world as we know it. Similarly to the Harambe's incident, a butterfly effect was
        believed to happen in early 2020. One of the most recognizable consequences of the event is
        the COVID-19 pandemic. This had led to the stagnation of multiple multimedia franchises,
        including rst itself. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- The event also was considered triggering point of multiple fictional events, such as
        Gin Minowa's death in the [Yuusha series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Yuna_is_a_Hero)
        and the aforementioned airship incident. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- Literally anything that had gone wrong after 2020 can be traced back to the incident,
        and therefore, this event has shaped the world as we know it. -->

        <!-- im not even depressed lmfao (like the ayumu dead people thing) -->
